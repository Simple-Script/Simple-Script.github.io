Write a Turing complete language that is focused on writing long scripts in single line code. There should be elements like “LOOP IF x = 0 THEN PRINT [Hello] ELSE PRINT [Bye]” the printed text is in brackets and use variables like SET x = 5 to set variables. The user can also make other variables like SET message = Hello. They can type PRINT message To output the message. If the user types PRINT [Hello] directly there must be brackets but if they print a variable there is no need for brackets. Add an INPUT function where the user can type OUTPUT PRINT [How old are you?] then the user can type the answer and then their answer is loaded INPUT so the code can be IF INPUT <0 PRINT [YOU'RE LYING] also add support for all operators.
